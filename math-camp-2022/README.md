Hello all,
 
Welcome to UT, the Government department, and to Austin. My colleague Matt Martin (he/him, 3rd year, Public Law) and I (Kenny Miao, he/him, 4th year, IR) will be your math camp instructors this August, and we are looking forward to meeting all of you. We're sending this e-mail to say hello and to share some information about math camp that you might find useful. Please feel free to send any questions that you might have to Kenny Miao (kenny.miao@utexas.edu).
 

Scheduling/Logistics
 
Here's our tentative schedule and location for math camp:
 
August 12 (Friday): 1:30pm - 4:30pm   [PAR 103]
*No math camp on the weekend (August 13-14)*
August 15 (Monday): 10am - 4:30pm   [BAT 1.104]
August 16 (Tuesday): 10am – 4:30pm   [PAR 103]
August 17 (Wednesday):  10am – 4:30pm [PAR 103]
August 18 (Thursday): 10am – 4:30pm   [PAR 103]
 
 
Format/Content
 
The primary goal of math camp is to make sure that everyone is (re)acquainted with the core mathematical tools and concepts that you will use in your methods classes: algebra, matrices, probability, basic calculus, and so on. We will also discuss math-adjacent topics such as UT's methods courses, statistical software, and best practices for project management (citation managers etc). Because we need to cover a wide range of topics in a relatively short time, the course moves fairly quickly.
 
The course is primarily lecture-based, though we'll break frequently to take questions and solve example problems (both individually and as a group). Most days you will receive a problem set that is due by the following class. The problem sets are not graded, and not intended to take up all of your free time; they're just intended to help you apply and internalize the concepts discussed in class. We'll go over the answers to each problem set on the day that it's due. There are no tests, quizzes, or examinations of any kind.
 

Things to do before math camp 
 
There are no "prerequisites" for math camp other than a basic understanding of arithmetic; though many of you may be familiar with some of the material from college or high school courses, the lectures do not assume any familiarity with the course material. Still, here are a few things we would like you to consider doing prior to math camp:
 
1. Download the syllabus (attached): The syllabus contains the (tentative) course schedule + a rough outline of the material. We may rearrange things a bit if we find we’re going too slowly or too quickly through any of the material.


2. Many of you will be using R extensively throughout graduate school and your careers as political scientists. R can be used to interface build new tools, as well as to interface with packages others have built. Accordingly, some of the math camp will be devoted to the teaching of R. This year, we’d like to try giving you a head start on the basics so that we can get into more of the challenging (and fun!) coding once you arrive. So we ask, if you do not have any previous experience working in R, that you go through the exercises in this online resource (link below). You do not need to download R to use it. The modules go really quick. We ask that everyone complete the first three tutorials ("Introduction","Data Frames","Data Cleaning"). If you get stuck, Google is a great resource and feel free to email one of us as well. You're welcome to do all the tutorials if you would like.

3. Download and install R, the statistical software/programming language, and RStudio, which is the interface that you will use to work in R. Please download R and install  from https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html (it doesn't matter which mirror you use) and then download and install Rstudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 



•Make sure you install R before RStudio.  Not doing so could potentially cause issues.



4. Please spend a few minutes filling out the following survey (<https://forms.gle/VFExHV2WJ5ubyKAK9>). It's completely anonymous, and our only purpose is to get a general idea of everybody's background so that we can pace our program appropriately.

5. This is totally optional, but if you would like further resources on math for social scientists, we are big fans of Will Moore and David Siegel's "A Mathematics Course for Political & Social Research." Harvard's political science department also publishes a free-to-access "Math Prefresher" that you may find helpful as an additional resource. Again, this is totally optional and not required for math camp.
 
Please be in touch with any questions or concerns. We're looking forward to math camping with all of you!


Best regards,
Matt + Kenny
